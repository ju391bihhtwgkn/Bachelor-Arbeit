RAG,Which arithmetic operations does Python have?,"Python has the following arithmetic operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Floor division (//)
- Modulo (%)
- Exponentiation (**)
- String concatenation using the + operator
- String duplication using the * operator","addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), floor division (//), modulo operation (%), ** operator for exponentiation.","Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor division operator // and the modulo operation % (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. 4 % -3 == -2). It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0,

The +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) // and

Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic

Expressions[edit]
Python's expressions include:

floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[103] Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.

Python uses the + operator for string concatenation. Python uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.
The @ infix operator. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[104][105]

The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[122]
Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed / to always be floating-point division, e.g. 5/2 == 2.5.

arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
assignment: =
augmented assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=
bitwise logic: ~, &, |, ^
bitwise shifts: <<, >>
Boolean logic: !, &&, ||
conditional evaluation: ? :
equality testing: ==, !=
calling functions: ( )

The language supports a rich set of operators, including bit manipulation, for integer arithmetic and logic, and perhaps different sizes of floating point numbers – it can process appropriately-structured data effectively.

The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[14]

A common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to Java. Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed, and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax

which runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.

RAG,Does C++ support operator overloading?,"Yes, C++ does support operator overloading. It provides more than 35 operators that can be overloaded for user-defined types. Some notable exceptions for overloading include member access and the conditional operator.","Yes, C++ does support operator overloading","C++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be overloaded for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access

Overloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as smart pointers. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands

a few notable exceptions such as member access (. and .*) and the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types.

However, unlike Java, C# supports operator overloading.[88]
C# also offers function overloading (a.k.a. ad-hoc-polymorphism).[89]

implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called dominance.

C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment.
If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.

Therefore, C++ supports not just object-oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as modular programming.

Most operators in C also appear in Swift, although some operators such as + have slightly different behavior. For example, in Swift, + traps on overflow, whereas &+ is used to denote the C-like behavior of wrapping on overflow.",0.12492658942937851,0.542224109172821,0.3257944881916046,0.586840808391571,0.23434309013743015,1.0000000000000007,0.9266666666481335,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.9,0.97
